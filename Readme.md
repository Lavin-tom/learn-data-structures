# Data Structure Concept in C

This repository contains code examples and explanations for a data structure concept implemented in C. 

## Getting Started

To compile and run these programs, you will need a C compiler such as GCC or Clang. You can install these compilers on your system using a package manager or by downloading them from their respective websites. Once you have a compiler installed, you can navigate to the directory containing the program you wish to run and use the `gcc` or `clang` command to compile it, like so:

```sh
$ gcc program.c -o program
$ ./program
```
